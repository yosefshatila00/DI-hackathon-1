Yosef,

You did a great project and your idea is well executed.
Your code is clean and readable. 
Adding a bit more structure with folders and comments could make it even easier to quickly follow your logic and decisions.

You successfully used all the features we learned in class, excellent work! This makes your Hackathon project feel complete.

Great job, keep up the good work!
